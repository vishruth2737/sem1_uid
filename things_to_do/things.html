            <td><h1>SURFING</h1><p class="text">Surfing was born in Hawaii and is deeply intertwined with its history and culture.
               If you dream of riding the waves, there’s no better place to learn how to surf and truly commune with the ocean. 
               Learn about the origins of surfing in Hawaii and find out where you can watch the pros or take a surfing lesson on your visit.
               Big wave season in Hawaii happens roughly between November and February on Hawaii’s north shores. You can watch surfers on every
                island, but some of the best surfing competitions in the world are held on Oahu’s North Shore in November and December, including 
                the biggest them of all, the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing. If you’re planning to watch the pros in action during these events, 
                be sure to get to the North Shore early because traffic can be heavy.Almost every island offers surfing lessons where you can learn 
                the basics of the sport. Lessons run from one to two hours and are taught by experienced surfers in gentle breaks. Longboards are used 
                to make it even easier for first-timers to learn, and a push from your instructor will help you get started. Waikiki Beach is still 
                one of the best spots in Hawaii to get on your feet and ride your first wave.Stand-up paddle boarding is a variation on surfing that 
                is becoming very popular Hawaii. In stand-up paddle boarding (SUP), riders stand upright on wider, longer boards and use a paddle to 
                maneuver. Great for a core muscle workout, SUP is often used more for fitness rather than for riding waves. Lessons are highly 
                recommended for your safety and for the safety of your fellow beachgoers and surfers.

          Shore of Oahu—this rocky bay with clear, shallow waters is one of the top snorkeling and shore-diving locales in the world
           (and no, sharks aren’t common here).World-class snorkeling and diving can be found just off the shore of Maui at Molokini Crater,
            where crystal-clear waters support an exceptional diversity of marine life.Lydgate Beach Park is protected by a rock barrier,
