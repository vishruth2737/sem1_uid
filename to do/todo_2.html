                                            The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu is the #1 Visitor Destination in the Hawaiian Islands. Over 2-million U.S. and international visitors choose to visit the Arizona Memorial every year to see where WWII began for America. There are 9 historic sites that contribute to the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument located in Alaska, California, and Hawaii. Five are at Pearl Harbor; the USS Arizona Memorial, USS Utah Memorial, USS Oklahoma Memorial, and areas within Battleship Row and Ford Island.

                                            FREE tours are available from 8am-3pm daily, (except for certain holidays). For more information about daily guided tours of the USS Arizona Memorial visit Pearl Harbor Tours.
                                            
                                            Located on over 17 acres, the recently renovated Pearl Harbor Visitor Center is now operated by the National Park Service. When visiting Pearl Harbor, guests can tour the whole Visitor Center but should be prepared to have a couple of hours if they want to take their time and see it all. Upon arrival, guests will be guided towards a ticket counter to receive movie tickets for a film that will summarize the history of this historic site and boat shuttle tickets for a trip to the USS Arizona Memorial. The film and the boat tour together are approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes. Guests will also have the option to arrange a headphone narrated tour at the ticket counter*
                                
                                            Pearl Harbor is the largest natural harbor within the State of Hawaii and was once referred to as ‘Pu’uloa’ by the ancient Hawaiians. The Hawaiian name directly translates to “water of pearl,” perfectly stated for the immense amounts of pearls that were once found in its waters.

                                        In ancient times, the coastal area of Waikiki in South Oahu once encompassed a larger area, including Manoa and Palolo Valley. The name Waikiki, in essence, means “spouting waters,” and refers to the freshwater rivers that once flowed towards the ocean. During the 1450‘s, Waikiki was designated as the very first government center in all of Hawaii.

                                        It was first a vacation destination for Hawaiian royalty, then foreign visitors began to frequent Waikiki in the 1830’s. The first hotel was opened in 1901, and a global trend was created! It was then that Waikiki started to become one of the most sought after vacation destinations in the world.
                                        Today, Waikiki is a gorgeous beach town spread across 1.5 square miles, lined by hotels, luxurious resorts, and decorated by a variety of restaurants, shopping centers, and nightlife. Waikiki Beach is a glory in its own with fabulous stories of Hawaiian entertainers like Hilo Hattie and Andy Cummings. Mainland celebrities that contributed to popularizing Waikiki were Clark Gable, Frank Sinatra, Shirley Temple, Bing Crosby, Amelia Earhart and Elvis Presley. Perhaps one of the most cherished Waikiki namesakes is Duke Kahanamoku, a celebrated Hawaiian hero, and a master waterman.
                                        
                                        When in Waikiki, take surf or stand up paddle lessons at Waikiki Beach, check out the Duke Kahanamoku statue, visit the Honolulu Zoo and the Waikiki Aquarium, walk through the international marketplace for gifts, souvenirs, and a chance to taste some local fare. Do not miss out on happy hour and some ono pupus (appetizers) at Duke’s Waikiki on Sundays to listen to notorious Hawaiian musician Henry Kapono.

                                           Visit the magical Island of Maui, and feel the power of the 10,023-ft dormant Mt. Haleakala all around you! When on the Valley Isle, visitors must seek out an adventure to Haleakala for a sunrise or a sunset, guided activities, hiking and camping trips. When visiting Haleakala for sunrise or sunset, plan for at least a 1 1/2 hour drive from Central Maui (Kahului) to the summit.

Due to the high elevation, the temperature drops, so bring something warm to wear for the unpredictable weather. Make sure you load up on gas, bring food and water, and check up on local sunrise and sunset times. Reservations must be made in advance.

If you’re planning on doing guided activities at the Haleakala Crater, plan ahead for all the most recent event information. Here, guests can gather together in an outdoor classroom and learn more about Maui’s geography, and Haleakala’s unique natural and cultural history. Park naturalists are extremely educated on all topics and easily engage all participants with science projects, demonstrations, and short guided hikes. If you’re planning a visit for a sunrise, you’ll need to be sure to make a parking reservation.

                                        The Island of Lana’i is a breathtakingly gorgeous, privately owned island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is also known as the “Pineapple Isle,” a title gained from becoming one of the world’s foremost pineapple growing locations in history. Located within Maui County, Lana’i does not have direct service from outside of Hawaii but can be reached by an inter-island flight from the Honolulu or Kahului Airport, or by ferry from Maui’s Lahaina Harbor.

                                        When on Lana’i, guests have only a handful of lodging options to choose from, including two Four Seasons Resorts, the Hotel Lana’i, private vacation rentals or camping. Whether you are visiting Lana’i only for the day or longer, we strongly suggest that you rent a 4×4 vehicle so that you can explore the variety of sites that Lana’i has to offer.
                                        
                                        On Lana’i, guests should definitely explore Keahiakawelo, also known as the Garden of the Gods. It is located 45 minutes from Lana’i City at the end of Polihua Road on the Northwest side of the island. Here, guests can visit an area full of Hawaiian history with an other-worldly landscape of rock towers, spires, boulders, and gorgeous Pacific Ocean views. Other places of interest on Lana’i include Sweetheart Rock and Puu Pehe Beach (a perfect place for a romantic outing with views), snorkeling and scuba diving at Hulopoe Bay, traveling down the Monroe Trail by horseback, and lavish luxury at world-class golf resorts.

                                            Experience ‘Old Hawai’i’ while venturing to the Big Island’s powerful volcanic landscape, witnessing its ecological dominance firsthand. Since 1916, the Big Island’s Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park has been the place to go for those who’d like to learn more about how the Hawaiian Islands were formed through a fascinating and eruptive timeline of events. Without a doubt, this is one of the most sought after places to go in all the Hawaiian Islands.

There are a variety of ways to explore the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, with main interests being the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, Jaggar Museum & Giftshop, and observing billowing steam vents, volcanic lava fields, fiery infernos, a 500-year old lava cave, the Halema’uma’u Crater, and Kilauea’s Caldera from a safe distance.

When visiting the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, plan ahead if you’d like to take a guided tour, a day hike or a longer backcountry hike. If you can only visit for a few hours, definitely try to explore the Kilauea Summit by journeying the 11-mile Crater Rim Drive. Here, guests can drive around the summit caldera, see desert and jungle landscapes, and have a chance to pull over and take short walks to scenic points of interest. Since there are ongoing volcanic eruptions on the Big Island, we highly suggest that guests check for visitor alerts and road closures, and always follow the guidance of the Hawai’i State Park Rangers.
